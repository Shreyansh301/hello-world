# H1 ** GREETINGS! ** :blush:
My first commit through code editor <br>
commands used in vs code :
cd /path/to/your/project <br>
git status <br>
git add filename.txt  # Replace "filename.txt" with the actual name of your file
git commit -m "Your commit message here" <br>
git push origin master  # Replace "master" with your branch name if different <br>
DONE <br>

A few more commands that helped me when i got stuck were :
`git fetch origin main:tmp`
`git rebase tmp`
